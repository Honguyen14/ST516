#### A Repository for ST516 Course - Computational Statistics

Hi Folks!

This is a repository for the **Computational Statistics** class, in *Spring, 2016*. We will be doing a lot of activities here. 
Run experiments, share code, exercises, ..., and Shiny Applications, like those I use in the class for simulating experiments. 
Once you have solved the exercises, push your codes and files. It'd be so nice if you do them using 
[rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). But simple R script files would be as good.
